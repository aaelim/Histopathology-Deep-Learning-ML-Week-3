# Histopathology-Deep-Learning-ML-Week-3

Histopath.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook and the best to visualize for peer grading.
Histopathology Week 3 Report is in pdf format for those that prefer this over a Jupyter notebook (download for higher quality visualization).
To run, all files need to be included in the relevant folders, all libraries need to be installed, and the Kaggle dataset (not included) needs to be downloaded.
Python scripts were used for convienence and are included as dataset.py, dsets.py, infer.py, model.py, and train.py and are placed with the /src folder.
